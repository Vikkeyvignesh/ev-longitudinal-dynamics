# EV Longitudinal Dynamics Simulation

This project focuses on modeling and validating the longitudinal dynamics of an electric vehicle using MATLAB/Simulink.

## Overview
The model evaluates vehicle motion and energy flow by considering:
- Traction motor and inverter behavior
- Vehicle load and road load forces
- Aerodynamic drag
- Rolling resistance

## Methodology
- Block-based modeling using MATLAB/Simulink
- Development of modular subsystems for forces, torque, and speed
- Model-in-the-Loop (MIL) validation for functional correctness
- Parameter variation to study efficiency and system behavior
- Simulation across standard drive cycles

## Key Outcomes
- Speed, torque, and energy flow evaluation
- Understanding of EV longitudinal performance
- Validation of control-oriented system models

## Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Simulink

## Status
Ongoing academic project as part of M.Tech coursework in Automotive Electronics.
